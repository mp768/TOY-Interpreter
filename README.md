# TOY-Interpreter
 a lox based language made for messing around with.
 
 This language attempt at the language will not be finished in this repository, but will be finished in a new repository made in c#. The new version will be on my github and will be a c# implementation of my own bytecode interpreter. This repository will be kept to show the progress I made from this to that.
